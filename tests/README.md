# tests directory

This directory will contain test modules (assuming I get time to write them) and data for testing or demonstrating OpticalRS. 
Test data will be divided into 3 sub directories, and there will be a 4th empty directory for outputs:

- `input_data`: The minimum set of data required for tests and/or demos
- `ancillary_data`: Extra data files that are helpful, but not strictly required
- `expected_output`: The outputs that are the expected results of tests and/or demos
- `test_output`: An empty directory where new results will be written
