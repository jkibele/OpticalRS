# Notes

As I'm rewriting v2.0, I'll want to keep track of some things.

Rasterio: I think I'll install via conda-forge: https://github.com/conda-forge/rasterio-feedstock
`conda install -c conda-forge rasterio`

Actually, conda was giving me problems. I've now gotten rid of conda.
I'm trying out `mambaforge` and using Python 3.8.
