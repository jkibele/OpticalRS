===========

This module implements methods described in Lyzenga et al. 2006. The methods
implemented so far are mostly the image preprocessing steps.

This implementation is the work of the author of this code (Jared Kibele), not
the authors of the original paper. I tried to get it  right but I'm not making
any promises. Please check your results and let me know if you find any
problems.

#     This is a special case of the sunglint method for WorldView-2 imagery. The
#     WV2 multispectral bands are divided into two groups, MS1 and MS2. The two
#     groups are captured at slightly different times. This means that not all the
#     visible bands covary with both NIR bands. This method splits the WV2 bands
#     and applies the Lyzenga glint correction method to MS1 and MS2 groups
#     separately, and then reassbles the results.

#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     imrds : OpticalRS.RasterDS
#         The raster dataset for the WV2 image that you'd like to correct.
#     glintgeom : shapely geometry
#         A polygon from within `imrds` that defines an area of optically deep
#         water with sun glint.
