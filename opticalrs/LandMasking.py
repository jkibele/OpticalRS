LandMasking
===========

This module contains methods for masking land in multispectral satellite imagery
based on thresholding the NIR band and filtering the result for mask
connectivity. This code also shows up in the `Multispectral Land Masker QGIS
plugin <https://github.com/jkibele/LandMasker>`_.

The methods in this module were developed by Jared Kibele but turned out to be
quite similar, in concept, to those used in Lyzenga et al. 2006.

def auto_water_threshold(imarr, nir_band=-1):
    """
    Estimate the NIR band threshold for masking water. This assumes that there
    will be a big peak in the KDE of the NIR band. It picks the first relative
    minimum after the global maximum of the KDE for the nir_band.

    Parameters
    ----------
    imarr : band array (see OpticalRS.RasterDS.band_array)
        The image array.
    nir_band : integer
        The (zero-indexed) band number to use as the NIR band. Typically, this
        should be the longest wavelength NIR band available. The default value
        (-1) will use the last band in the array.

    Returns
    -------
    threshold
        The NIR value below which pixels should be considered water and above
        which pixels should be considered land.

    ----------
    in_array : numpy array
        A 2D binary array.
    threshold : int (optional, default=1000)

    structure : numpy array (optional)

    Notes
    -----
    The output from this method should be used as input for the
    connectivity_filter method defined above. This will remove the isolated
    pixels on land that are marked as water.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_arr : numpy.array
        An array of shape (Rows,Columns). Should be a NIR band. For WorldView-2
        imagery, I use band 8 (NIR2).
    threshold : int or float

        considered water and be marked as 1 in the output.

    Return a masked array where land is masked and water is not. This is
    accomplished by looking at the longest wavelength band (assumed to be the
    last band), masking everything above nir_threshold, and then masking
    unmasked pixels connected to fewer than conn_threshold unmasked pixels.

    ----------
    imarr : numpy.array
        An array of shape (Rows,Columns,Bands). The multipectral image you wish
        to mask.
    nir_threshold : int or float (optional, default=100)
        The pixel value cut-off. Pixels with a value lower than this will be
        considered water and be left unmasked. Pixels with a value above will
        be considered land and will be masked. In practice, you can determine
        this value by looking at a histogram of NIR values or examining pixel
        NIR values on water and land.

        Groups of unmasked pixels connected to fewer than this number of other
        unmasked pixels will be masked.
